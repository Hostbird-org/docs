## What is Hostbird?

Hostbird was founded with a clear vision: to create a digital organisation that combines flexibility, security, and scalability, designed to support businesses and creatives of all sizes. Our roots trace back to 2010, when the digital landscape was still evolving, and many were just beginning to explore the vast potential of the online world. During this time, we built a solid foundation of technical expertise, learning the intricacies of web development, hosting, and design as the industry grew and transformed.

We thrive to make Hostbird a friendly place where privacy is respected, and we run a no-bullshit, no-gimmicks operation that's suitable for all: from individuals needing a solo website, to people who need to rent dedicated servers and do everything by themselves.
