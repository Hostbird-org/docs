<Info>
  **Note:** We do not stop you from running your own mail server if you decide to do so, however by default for all of our customers we offer Migadu by default. By that, it means you need to accept their [terms of service](https://migadu.com/terms/) which is very straightforward, and you'll receive quality email with very high rated reachability.&#x20;
</Info>

At Hostbird, we have chosen to partner with Migadu for email hosting services. This decision stems from the complexity of implementing a reliable email hosting solution and our commitment to providing you with the best possible service. Migadu offers a comprehensive suite of features tailored to meet diverse email needs.

**Why doesn't Hostbird offer email hosting directly?**

Establishing a dependable email hosting service involves more than just installing email software. It requires continuous maintenance, security updates, and adherence to evolving email protocols to ensure optimal performance and security. By partnering with Migadu, we leverage their expertise to deliver a robust and secure email experience without compromising quality.

<Warning>
  You cannot use Migadu for a newsletter. It's meant for email communication, normal usage. If you're planning to run a newsletter service with us, rent a server and setup everything there.
