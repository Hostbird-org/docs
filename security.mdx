## Introduction

At Hostbird, we take security seriously. We recognise the valuable role that security researchers and the wider community play in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities. This policy outlines how to report security issues and what to expect from us in response.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Hostbird’s services, applications, or infrastructure, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

* Email us at [**security@hostbird.org**](mailto:security@hostbird.org) with details of the vulnerability.

* Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any supporting materials such as screenshots or logs.

* If possible, provide proof-of-concept code demonstrating the issue.

### What We Expect

* Act in good faith and avoid exploiting the vulnerability.

* Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have had a chance to address it.

* Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting any user data that is not your own.

## Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** – We will confirm receipt of your report within **48 hours**.

2. **Assessment** – Our security team will evaluate the report and determine its impact.

3. **Remediation** – If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix.

4. **Notification** – We will keep you updated on the progress and, if applicable, publicly disclose the fix once deployed.

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:

* Hostbird’s web applications

* Hostbird’s infrastructure and APIs

* Official Hostbird mobile and desktop applications

### Out of Scope

* Social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing)

* Issues in third-party services or libraries not maintained by Hostbird

* Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to our systems

## Safe Harbour

We commit to not taking legal action against researchers who follow this policy in good faith. If you adhere to responsible disclosure practices, we will not pursue claims against you for security research conducted within the scope of this policy.
